# RoverChallenge

# Can you design an application to control the movements of NASAâ€™s next Mars rover?
# Instructions:
# 1.   You have been told that your exploration area on Mars is a 100 metres x 100 metres square. 
# 2.   The area has been divided into a 100 x 100 grid of numbered squares. 
# 3.   The squares are numbered from 1 through to 10,000.
# 4.   The rover starts its journey located in square number 1, it is facing south and can either turn left, 
#      right or move forward a given number of metres. The rover can take a maximum of 5 commands at any time. 
# 5.   After each set of commands, the rover reports back its current position and the direction that it is facing. 
 
# For example, here is a set of 5 commands:
#    50m
#    Left
#    23m
#    Left
#    4m
  	
# The above set of commands would cause the rover to report back position 4,624 north.
# The next set of commands would then continue from the square where the rover finished. 

# Please note that the rover cannot venture outside of the 100 x 100 area. 
# If the rover is instructed to cross the perimeter of the exploration area, 
# it will halt and refuse to execute any additional queued commands
